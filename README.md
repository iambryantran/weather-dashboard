# Weather Dashboard

## This Repository

This repository is where I am working a weather dashboard as part of a coding bootcamp. The main objective of this assignment is to practice using an API. 

## Usage

To use this website, search the name of the city in the search box on the left.  The right side will populate with the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days.

## Screenshots (WIP)
